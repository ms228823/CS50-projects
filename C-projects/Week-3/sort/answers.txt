sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: It takes so much time in unsorted problem than sorted problem since that: real in random50000 using sort1 = 10.089s,real in sorted50000 using sort1 = 2.411s,real in reversed50000 using sort1 = 2.823s

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: It takes the same time in unsorted problem and in sorted problem,It takes the same time in O and in Î©, "the fastest algorithm", and "it is a FETA"  since that: real in random50000 using sort2 = 1.766s,real in sorted50000 using sort2 = 2.707s,real in reversed50000 using sort2 = 2.823s

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?:  It takes the same time in unsorted problem and in sorted problem, And "it is a FETA" since that: real in random50000 using sort3 = 6.3685s,real in sorted50000 using sort3 = 6.260s,real in reversed50000 using sort3 = 5.207s
